# Search Autocomplete System

Implemented a scalable search autocomplete system optimized for suggesting top k queries to users in constant time.

## System Overview

The system employs a custom Trie (prefix tree) data structure to optimize prefix-based search operations. As users input queries, 
the Trie dynamically processes the input, enabling real-time query suggestions. Additionally, user-submitted queries are logged 
and aggregated weekly, ensuring the availability of relevant suggestions for improved search results.
